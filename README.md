## Introduction

Welcome to the open-source Next.js E-Commerce Storefront with Admin Panel project! This project is built with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Prisma, providing a powerful and flexible solution for building and managing your e-commerce website.

## Features

-  **Next.js Framework**: A popular React framework for building server-rendered React applications.
-  **TypeScript**: Strongly typed codebase for improved maintainability.
-  **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
-  **Prisma**: An open-source database toolkit for Node.js that simplifies database access with type-safe queries.
-  **E-Commerce Functionality**: Implement and manage product listings, shopping cart, and orders.
-  **Admin Panel**: A user-friendly admin panel for managing products, orders, and customers.
-  **Authentication**: Secure user authentication for both customers and administrators.
-  **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly storefront for an optimal shopping experience.

## Development

Navigate to each of 2 apps inside the `apps` folder and go steps below:

#### Install dependencies

```sh
yarn install
```

#### Build and run packages

```sh
yarn dev
```

## Authentication

The authentication is handled using JWT tokens stored in cookies and verified inside the `middleware.ts` file. The middleware function takes in the HTTP request, reads the `token` cookie and if the JWT is successfully verified, it sets the `X-USER-ID` header with the userId as the value, otherwise the request is sent back with 401 status.
